# FullCombo Mihomo

## Features

- Gateway level Transparent proxy
- Gateway level FullCone NAT
- Access control Whitelist/Blacklist
- Routing control based on Port/IP/FQDN
- Complete DNS hijacking prevents any 53 port query behavior that bypasses the gateway
- DNS requests intelligent routing based on EDNS-Client-Subnet/Policy
- Based on mihomo documentation, fully visual configuration GUI

## Requirements

- OpenWrt >= 23.05
- firewall4

## Known issues

- The **Routing rule** and **Sub rule** of the LuCI app have been migrated from `mihomo` format to `json` format.</br>
  If find `option oldentry` in `/etc/config/fchomo` file, the selected config may not be migrated correctly.</br>
  You need to manually reset the selected config and remove the `oldentry` option when you are done.

## Releases

You can find the prebuilt-ipks [here](https://fantastic-packages.github.io/packages/)

## Compatibility with MihomoTProxy

Core:

- The Mihomo core provided by FullCombo Mihomo only contains binaries and does not have daemons.
- So in theory you can use the mihomo core provided by MihomoTProxy.

LuCI application:

- FullCombo Mihomo and MihomoTProxy can be installed on the same device, but cannot be started as clients at the same time.
